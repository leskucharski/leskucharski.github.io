	    <p><i>Les Kucharski of late 2024 has to say the following:</i></p>

            <div style="max-width: 50%; margin: auto;">
	    <p>This is an album about nothing in particular. If you feel like you're getting wind of any sort of
	    meaning to the lyrics, ignore it, otherwise I will get embarrassed. I will admit to Work Experience
	    being half-about the joys of testicular trauma, and No One Owes being about the gaping maw that
	    developing a crush on your best friend will leave you with when it all goes pear-shaped.</p>

	    <p>Songs were written over about 2 years, starting when I was 16. Then a lot of it stayed in a
	    Stasis until this year. The recording of this album was made up of long periods of nothing waiting
	    for no one to be in the family home - then brief flurries of screaming down a mic drunk off bad
	    wine, or geeking in the garage all strapped into a guitar on acid/dexies trying to set up an
	    amplifier in the March humidity. 90% of the tracking was completed in 3 months, then the final
	    10% (due to scheduling difficulties as opposed to any technical challenges) took about 9 more -
	    in those months I got very bored and tired of these fucking songs that 17 year old me wrote.</p>

            <p>Drums were real simple - condenser underkit getting the snare bottom and a kick, dynamic overhead
            for that crunchy King Gizzard-type tone. I fucked around a lot more with the mics for guitar and
            usually had two recording, one close and one far perhaps pointing at a corner or wall - did this
            for both electric and acoustic guitars. Sometimes a dynamic room-condenser close mic setup works
            best, sometimes the opposite.</p>

            <p>Bass was just the two about standing height off a massive amp cab my dad built when he was
            my age, maybe a foot or two back, and I'd just pick the better sounding one, which really
            depended on whether you wanted a more powerful kick drum or bassline. Stereo piano was recorded
            using a similar technique to the guitars (just the second mic was normally a bit closer), and
            this yielded perversely good results given I was combining a Realistic Highball and a Behringer C-1.</p>

            <p>All horns (Trombone, Alto Sax, and octave-shifted alto sax that emulated a Baritone Sax) went
            into the dynamic. 3 different vocal mics were used with no particular rationale to their selection: 
            the dynamic on most tracks and all harmonies, a few songs with the condenser, and actually a
            fair number with a ribbon mic - built by my dad with 3d printing, some aluminium foil, a couple
            of tiny neodymium bar magnets, and a wee transformer soldered up to an XLR output. Love you Dad.</p>

            <p>I puked a lot and spent a lot of 48-hour chunks awake trying to polish the turd that was this album.
            I hope it's not too clapped and you can handle the hamfisted Reaper bus compression/limiting. I'm
            still proud of it but I know I can do a hell of a lot better, and will be doing so quite soon...</p>
